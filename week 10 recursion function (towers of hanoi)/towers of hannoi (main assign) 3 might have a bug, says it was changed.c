// I feel like my recursive function passes a lot of information each call... but It came most naturally... I assume there is something with less passing involved and im curious what it is.
// my recursion looks a lot like a loop, I have the impression that a good recursive function is deceptively simple... my function comes across a modified loop--- not as simple as it should be... I really get the idea im doing this wrong

	the wiki page on hanoi tower noted something about starting on different pegs depending if it's odd or even. I wrote a little diagram holding each peg (source) for odd and even # of disks and wrote the corresponding movement.
	odd:
	a -> c
	b -> c
	c -> b
	even:
	a -> b
	b -> a
	c -> a
	... I found these to be constant for the 4 disk puzzle and I assume it continues to be for each puzzle of greater scale, so I modeled my code after it... 
		- I'm unsure about whether looking at the chart dodged some of the work... I get the feeling that there might have been some concept that I forwent... frankly im wondering, did i cheat by using the chart- or was it ok?
		-Also, in the lesson's pseudo-code I didnt understand the 'spare' or the  'diskNumber-1' variables--- and they are shuffled around in each call... were they just there for examples? or was there meaning behind them
		(or the plain disknumber --- i assume it was what im using as size but then i dont understand the -1 so it confused me)
